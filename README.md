# The Project CoffEE
Enterprise Software is cool!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of `create-react-app` guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Notes:
 - Different errors should be a type, not a msg. the view should decide the error text
 - Events should be different types, not an enum. easier to not share everything from the engine to the view
 - hook callback function on rooms/items that can change the game state as it suits them

# QuestZone
### The quest for the holy artifact

This is the text adventure game project for [QuestZone](https://superdupersecretstash.javazone.no/). The [JavaZone original 2018 movie: Stranger Strings](https://youtu.be/EAH3i6l8PbY) companion game. The game has a central role in the movie and is fully playable here: https://superdupersecretstash.javazone.no/.

QuestZone is made to look like the old text based adventure like Zork, but playable in a modern browser. This project contains both the game script for QuestZone and the engine built to run the script. You may delete the game script and use the engine for something else if you wish. QuestZone is mobile friendly and follows the WCAG 2 guidelines.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of `create-react-app` guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Puzzle design tips: 
Mostly tips for ourselves

1. Provide clear goals
    - should always know what their short and long term goals are, so they know witch puzzles to solve and have the motion to do so
2. Use signposting
    - Add many clues on how to solve a puzzle. either by looking at stuff or talking to people
    - Signposting is like providing lots of little subtile goals for those that are listening and looking carefully
3: Give Feedback: 
    - A puzzle should help solve it self by giving feedback. Letting you know if you are on the right track

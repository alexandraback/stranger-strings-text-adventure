##Tips
### A good puzzle design should

1. Provide clear goals
    - should always know what their short and longterm goals are, so they know witch puzzles to solve and have the motion to do so
2. Use signposting
    - Add many clues on how to solve a puzzle. either by looking at stuff or talking to people
    - signposting is like providing lots of little subtile goals for those that are listening and looking carefully
3: Give Feedback: 
    - A puzzle should help solve it self by giving feedback. Letting you know if you are on the right track
